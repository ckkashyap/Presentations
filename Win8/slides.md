# Windows 8 application life model

* Unlike in Windows 7, the system manages the life of the app
* The states of an app
      * Running
      * Suspended
      * Terminated

# Applications are activated by contracts

* Contracts such as
      * Launch
      * Search
      * Share Target
* App gets an activated callback
      * It receives a "kind" that identifies how it was activated
* There is a consistent splash screen
      * Logo and Color needs
* If your app takes longer than 15 seconds, you must use the extended splash screen

# The suspend message

* The app gets 5 seconds after receiving the suspend message
      * Apps must register for the suspend message
      * Apps can optionally register for a resume message
* Suspended processes remain in memory and can be resumed instentaneously

# Save data incrementally

* Imagine a simple text editor getting terminated

# Live tiles to make the app look like its running

* Push notifications
* Background Audio / Background transfer API
* Lock screen apps
