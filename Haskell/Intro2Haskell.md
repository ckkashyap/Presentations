# What I am going to cover

* What is functional programming

* Why it matters

* Haskell

# This is not a tutorial on Haskell

* I am merely going to attempt to get you excited about Haskell!

# Why?

# To make the world a happier place

# Seriously - Why?

  * After all languages hardly matter - it's the algorithms really
      * Well not according to Paul Graham
      * Also not according to Eric Raymond 

            Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; 
            that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, 
            even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.
      * Languages vary in power!!!

# Languages vary in power

   * Beating the averages by Paul Graham
   * High level languages are more powerful than machine language
   * But are all high level languages equal?
     * Remember! COBOL is a high level language
   * Blub paradox!

# Some literature that talks about the importance of FP

* 1977 - Can Programming Be Liberated from the Von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs - John Backus, IBM
* 1990 - Why Functional Programming Matters - John Huges
* 2001 - Beating the Averages - Paul Graham, Yahoo! Y Combinator 

# What is functional programming

- It is a programming paradigm where functions are first class values
