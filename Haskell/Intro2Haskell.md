# What I am going to cover

* What is functional programming

* Why it matters

* Haskell

# This is not a tutorial on Haskell

* I am merely going to attempt to get you excited about FP in geneal and Haskell in particular!

# What is Functional Programming?

   * It is a programming paradigm where functions are first class values

   * Functions are data!!!
     * In maths, functions are essentially maps that map values from a domain to a range!     

   * Functions vs Procedures

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    f1 :: Int -> Int
    f1 x = x + x

    f2 :: Int -> Int
    f2 x = 2 * x
    ~~~~

    Are f1 and f2 the same function?

# Lineages

   * Procedural languages have their roots in Turing Machine (Von Neuman Architecture)
   
   * FP on the other hand has its root in lambda calculus





# Why should I learn functional programming?

   * To make the world a happier place

# Seriously - Why?

  * I have a lot of reasons not to!!!
     * I am very comfortable with X which allows me to do everything
   
     * X is industry standard
      
     * X has a lot of support - IDE, debugger etc
  
     * And come on - I have not seen any job posting for Haskell!!!

  * Besides languages dont matter - it's the algorithms that do
      * Well not according to Paul Graham
      * Also not according to Eric Raymond 

            Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; 
            that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, 
            even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.
      * Languages vary in power!!!

# Languages vary in power

   * Beating the averages by Paul Graham
   * High level languages are more powerful than machine language
   * But are all high level languages equal?
     * Remember! COBOL is a high level language
   * Blub paradox!
   * "that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]"

# So which is the most powerful language?

   * What could be the parameters to measure the power of a language
   * 1990 - Why Functional Programming Matters - John Huges

# Modularity is the key

   * Modular design brings with it great productivity improvements
     * Small modules can be coded correctly, quickly and easily
     * General purpose modules could be reused for subsequent programs
     * Modules could be tested independently
     * Conceptual modularity vs Clerical modularity
